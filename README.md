# Introduction

This is a demo plugin for WCEU 2023 that adds two "back to top" links to the footer of a WordPress site. One link is generated with JavaScript, the second is generated with PHP.

This plugin utilizes basic translation functions for both JavaScript and PHP.

This plugin is not intended for use in production. It is for demonstration purposes only.
